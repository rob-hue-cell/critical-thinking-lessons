              "content": "Every great structure begins with its smallest unit. In reasoning, those units are claims—statements about the world that can be true or false. They are the bricks of logic, the atoms of understanding. Once you learn to spot them, you start seeing the invisible skeleton behind every argument, every news story, every conversation. This is where thinking begins: not with answers, but with clear statements waiting to be tested."

              "content": "Claims give shape to thought. They tell the listener, ‘Here is what I believe about the world.’ Without them, discussion dissolves into fog. When you identify a claim, you give your mind something to grasp—a sentence that can be weighed, examined, or refined. Clarity starts here."

              "content": "A claim is a declaration that can, at least in principle, be true or false. It doesn’t need to be correct to count; it only needs to make a testable assertion. ‘The Earth orbits the Sun’ is a claim. So is ‘The Moon is made of cheese.’ The first aligns with evidence, the second doesn’t—but both are claims because both can be checked."

              "title": "Truth Value",
              "content": "Every claim carries a truth value: true, false, or uncertain. Think of truth value as gravity. It keeps reasoning from drifting into pure opinion. A claim without a truth value isn’t reasoning—it’s noise. When you ask, ‘Could this be tested?’, you’re already thinking critically."

              "content": "Beliefs live inside people. Claims live in language. You can believe privately that the ocean heals the soul, but until you express it—‘The ocean heals the soul’—it remains invisible to reasoning. The moment belief becomes claim, it steps into the light, where it can be examined, refined, or even strengthened."

              "content": "Some sentences sound like claims but aren’t. Questions, commands, and exclamations—‘Is it raining?’, ‘Close the door!’, ‘Wow!’—don’t assert anything to test. They express emotion or action, not truth. Recognizing this keeps your mental workshop clean."

              "content": "Emotion often hides assertion. When someone says, ‘That’s ridiculous,’ the hidden claim is, ‘That idea is false.’ Beneath tone and gesture, logic whispers. Learning to hear that whisper gives you x-ray vision in conversation—you begin to notice what’s actually being said beneath the noise."
