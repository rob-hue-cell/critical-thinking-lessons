They are the 🧱 **bricks of logic**, the **atoms of understanding**.\n\nOnce you learn to **spot them**, you begin to see the **invisible skeleton** behind every argument, every news story, every conversation.\n\n💡 *This is where thinking begins:* not with answers, but with **clear statements waiting to be tested.**"

When you **identify a claim**, you give your mind something solid to grasp — a sentence that can be **weighed, examined, or refined**.\n\n💡 **Clarity starts here.**"

It doesn’t need to be correct to count — only **testable**.\n\n🧠 *Example:* “The Earth orbits the Sun” is a claim. So is “The Moon is made of cheese.” The first aligns with evidence; the second doesn’t — but both can be **checked**.\n\n💡 What matters is the **possibility of testing** — that’s what makes it reasoning."

Think of truth value as **gravity**: it keeps reasoning from drifting into opinion.\n\n⚖️ A claim without truth value isn’t reasoning — it’s noise.
